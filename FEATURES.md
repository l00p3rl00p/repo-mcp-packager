# Features & Capabilities: The Activator (repo-mcp-packager)

**Universal Deployment & Environment Isolation for the Workforce Nexus.**

The Activator is the primary engine for transforming repositories into production-ready AI tools while maintaining a "Clean Room" policy. This document provides a high-density reference for installation strategies, isolation logic, and the Phase 9 hardening suite.

## 📊 Installation Strategy Matrix

| Strategy | Mode | Reliability | Environment | Use Case |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Full Install** | Interactive | **96-99%** | Managed `.venv` | Complex Python/Node projects |
| **Lightweight** | `--lite` | **93%** | Shell Shim (`.sh`) | Single-file scripts / Portability |
| **Permanent** | `--permanent`| **99.999%** | Nexus Infra | Mission-critical deployments |
| **Headless** | `--headless` | **Automated**| Non-interactive | CI/CD / AI Agent replication |

## 🔍 Clean Room Architecture

The Activator ensures that no tool pollutes the global host system by strictly gating environment variables and binaries.

## 💻 Command Matrix (Lookup)

| Operation | Command | Primary Flag | Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Install** | `python install.py` | (None) | Standard interactive deployment |
| **Update** | `python install.py` | `--update` | Pull code + re-harden permissions |
| **Bridge** | `python install.py` | `--generate-bridge` | Wrap legacy code for AI use |
| **Library** | `python install.py` | `--with-library` | Deploy Librarian alongside repo |
| **Rollback** | (Automatic) | (None) | Triggered on installation failure |

## 🔐 Intelligent Resolution & Hardening (Phase 9)

The Activator features a multi-layer safety suite to ensure executables "Just Work" on the first try:

1.  **Entry Point Resolution**: If a folder contains both `.py` and `.sh` entry points, the Activator prompts the user (or recommends the portable `.sh` option).
2.  **Auto-Chmod Enforcement**: Automatically sets the execute bit (`chmod +x`) on:
    *   Internal Nexus tools (`mcp.py`, `bootstrap.py`, etc.).
    *   Discovered user scripts in target repositories.
    *   Generated `install.sh` wrappers.
3.  **Permissions Audit**: During updates, the Activator re-verifies that all mapped executables are still granted appropriate permissions.

## 🗑️ Surgical Reversal (Uninstall)

The `uninstall.py` tool uses the **Nexus Manifest Layer** to ensure zero-residue cleanup:
*   **Artifact Removal**: Only files listed in `manifest.json` are deleted.
*   **PATH Cleaning**: Uses `# Shesha Block` markers to surgically extract shell configuration edits.
*   **Nexus Protection**: Refuses to delete the `~/.mcp-tools` home unless it is completely empty or the `--force` flag is used.
