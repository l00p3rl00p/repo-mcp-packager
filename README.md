# MCP Workforce Nexus: The Activator

Last updated: 2026-02-11

**The primary engine for deploying, hardening, and unifying MCP server environments with industrial-grade reliability.**

The **Activator** orchestrates the Workforce Nexus, transforming raw GitHub repositories into production-ready AI tools. It handles environment isolation, structural auditing, and atomic deployments.

## 🧹 One-Command Full Wipe (Start Fresh)

Run a complete wipe (remove local venv + shared suite data) with:

```bash
python3 uninstall.py --kill-venv --purge-data
```

Safety: this uninstaller only touches approved central locations (e.g. `~/.mcp-tools`, `~/.mcpinv`, and the Nexus PATH block). It does **not** scan your disk or delete anything in your git workspace.

## 🧩 IDE Injection During Install

During `--permanent/--industrial` installs, the installer will prompt (TTY only) to auto-detect MCP-capable IDEs and offer to inject the suite tools into them.

## ♻️ Intelligent Re-runs (Anti-Lazy Mode)

If you run `python3 bootstrap.py` again and an existing install is detected in `~/.mcp-tools`, the installer will offer an action menu so you don’t have to hunt commands:

- Install / Repair
- Configure IDE injection (creates/updates the global injector config)
- Launch GUI
- Uninstall (full wipe)
- Exit

## ⚡ Quick Start: Standalone Activator

Install a single repository as a portable MCP server immediately:

```bash
python3 serverinstaller/install.py
```
*Selection tip: Follow the prompts to detect Python/Node and generate an `install.sh` shim.*

---

## 🚀 Package Start: The Workforce Nexus

Deploy the entire hardened Nexus suite to `~/.mcp-tools` in one command:

```bash
python3 bootstrap.py --gui
```
*Selection tip: Use `--gui` to auto-launch the dashboard after installation.*

## 📊 Reliability Tier Comparison

All tiers include **Universal Safety (Pre-flight & Rollback)**.

| Tier | Flag | Convergence Area | Strategy | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **Lite** | `--lite` | **Distributed** | Zero-Dep | Portable, Atomic Reversal, Auto-Chmod |
| **Standard** | (Default) | **Linked** | Pure Python | Structural Audit, Regex Indexing, Symlinks |
| **Industrial** | `--permanent` | **Unified** | Infrastructure | Managed Venv, `jsonschema`, `psutil`, `PyYAML` |

## 🌟 Core Capabilities

*   **Atomic Transactions**: Multi-tool installation that reverts completely on failure.
*   **Suite Synergy**: Detects sibling tools and triggers "Application Convergence" for a unified experience.
*   **Intelligent Resolution**: Prompt/Recommend between multiple entry points (e.g., `.sh` vs `.py`).
*   **Auto-Chmod Enforcement**: Automatically sets execute bits on all entry points and dependencies.
*   **Pre-flight Intelligence**: Verifies disk health and permissions before execution.
*   **Headless Mode**: Zero-touch replication for automated agents.

---

## 🔐 Universal Safety & Rollback

Every operation follows a strict **Pre-flight -> Track -> Commit/Rollback** pattern.

## 🛠️ Workforce Nexus Command Reference

| Tool | Shared Command | Direct Module Execution | Responsibility |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Activator** | `mcp-activator` | `python3 bootstrap.py` | Orchestration, Installation, Sync |
| **Observer** | `mcp-observer` | `python3 -m mcp_inventory.cli` | UI/GUI, Health, Inventory |
| **Surgeon** | `mcp-surgeon` | `python3 mcp_injector.py` | Injection, Config Hardening |
| **Librarian** | `mcp-librarian` | `python3 mcp.py` | Knowledge SQLite, URL Persistence |

## 🖥️ GUI Management (The Observer Dashboard)

The **Observer GUI** is your primary interface for monitoring the health and connection status of all Nexus components.

*   **To Launch:**
    ```bash
    mcp-observer gui
    # OR (Direct)
    python3 -m mcp_inventory.cli gui
    ```
*   **Dashboard URL:** [http://localhost:8501](http://localhost:8501)
*   **To Stop:**
    - Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where the GUI is running.
    - Closing the terminal session will also terminate the server.
*   **To Restart:** Simply run the launch command again. The GUI will automatically re-index the current inventory.

## 🌍 Global Path & Workspace Context

### 1. Setting the PATH
For the `mcp-` commands to work from any directory, ensure your shell configuration (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`) includes the Nexus bin directory:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.mcp-tools/bin:$PATH"
```
*(The Industrial/Standard bootstrap attempts to automate this step during installation.)*

### 2. Execution Directory
*   **Installation/Sync:** Always run `bootstrap.py` from the `repo-mcp-packager` root.
*   **Daily Use:** Once installed, all `mcp-` commands can be executed from **any directory** within your workspace.

---

## 🧩 GUI Control Surface (Tier-Aware)

The GUI scaffold in `repo-mcp-packager/gui/` is a control surface over CLI behavior:

*   **Lite**: only lite-safe actions should run; non-lite actions appear visually unchecked.
*   **Standard**: enables linked-workspace actions and operational commands.
*   **Permanent**: enables hardened infrastructure actions (managed venv/path/integrity workflows).

The widget model maps to the command catalog and executes through an allowlisted backend runner, reporting command output and status.

# Application Convergence & Synergy
The "Nexus Application" mode is triggered when the bootstrapper detects all four modules (mcp-injector, mcp-link-library, mcp-server-manager, repo-mcp-packager) in the same workspace.

Convergence Matrix (Organization & Areas)
Feature	Lite (Loose Binding)	Standard (Close Binding)	Industrial (Managed App)
Philosophy	"Distributed & Portable"	"Cohesive & Linked"	"Monolithic & Hardened"
Logic Area	Repos remain in workspace	~/.mcp-tools/suite (Symlinks)	~/.mcp-tools/app (Managed Mirror)
Shared Base	~/.mcp-tools/lite/	~/.mcp-tools/standard/	~/.mcp-tools/industrial/
Environment	OS-Default / Manual Venv	Per-module local venvs	Single Unified Hardened Venv
Update Path	Manual per repo	Live (via Symlinks)	On-Demand (nexus-sync)
Global Path	Optional (Local first)	Recommended	Mandatory Enforcement
