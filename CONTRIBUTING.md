# Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project!

## Our Philosophy

We will accept **any edit that makes the project better**.

Whether it's a bug fix, a new feature, a documentation update, or a performance improvement, if it adds value, we want it.

## The Golden Rule: Maintain the Package Linkage

This repository is part of a 3-repository suite that forms a complete package:

1. **mcp-injector**
2. **mcp-server-manager**
3. **repo-mcp-packager**

**CRITICAL:**
You must ensure that your changes **do not break the link** between these three repositories. They are tightly integrated and depend on each other to function correctly as a whole.

- **Do** improve individual components.
- **Do not** break the interoperability between them.

If your change affects the integration, please ensure you have tested it across all three repositories.
